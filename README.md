# 👋 Hi there, I'm Torsten (@torstenkn)

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm passionate about **Medical Devices**, **Combination Products**, and **Software Development**—especially when these worlds intersect to improve patient outcomes. With nearly 30 years in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, I've worked across Quality, Development, Vigilance, and Operations. These days, I'm diving deeper into **Python** and **Django** to explore how software can enhance quality systems and digital health solutions.

## 💡 What I'm Into
- 🔬 Quality and innovation in **Medical Devices** and **Drug-Device Combinations**
- 🧑‍💻 Developing practical tools and prototypes using **Python**, **Django**, and modern web tech
- 🌍 Digital transformation in pharma—where **AI**, **data**, and **compliance** meet
- 👶 Coaching youth soccer and applying agile teamwork on and off the field

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate
I'm always open to contributing to interesting projects—especially those at the intersection of **healthcare**, **tech**, and **quality**. Whether it's a Django-based tool or a digital health idea, feel free to reach out.
